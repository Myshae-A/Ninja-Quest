It contains the runnable .jar file in a google drive. (all code should be same as the code in gitHub, this is much easier than the below method).

How to run this github project with VS Code:
01) Download git here: https://git-scm.com/download/win 
02) Open Visual Studio Code
03) Make sure to have downloaded the GitHub pull-requests & Issues extension
04) Click the bottom-left corner settings “gear-looking” icon
05) Click command palette.
06) Type in Github clone, and the “Clone from GitHub” option should appear. Then click it.
07) Paste this inside of it: https://github.com/Myshae-A/Ninja-Quest and press enter
08) Create a new folder where the project gets stored (can be named anything and stored anywhere, preferably put in in desktop temporarily so you can delete it afterwards easily if so desired)
09) Click “select repository location” and the project should save properly.
10) If it worked properly, the project should have opened in VS Code and should be runnable. You should also be able to open the project by selecting the folder you created when you “open a new folder” in VS Code.
11) If it’s not working, here is a link to a YouTube video that runs through the same steps: https://youtu.be/_ynMa2XlRgk?si=OPM2LyTAwecflPt3
